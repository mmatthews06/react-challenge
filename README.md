# Simple Coding Experiment/Challenge
This is a web app coding challenge that I came up with for my company. It's an example of React, with hook, and excellent testing, done in 5 hours, so it purposely lacks some visual polish.

# Install and Run
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. This was developed with v12.8.0
2. Checkout the code, and `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Upload the CSV file in the `data/` directory, via the app's `Upload Samples` button.

# Unit Tests
* Run `npm test` to watch for file changes.
* Run `npm run test:coverage` to see a coverage report.
