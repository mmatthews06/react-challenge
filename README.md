# Q2 Coding Challenge
This is one functional solution for the coding challenge - except it's in React.

# Install and Run
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. This was developed with v12.8.0
2. Checkout the code, and `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start`
5. Upload the CSV file in the `data/` directory, via the app's `Upload Samples` button.
